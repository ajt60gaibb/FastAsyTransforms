# FastAsyTransforms

Implementations of a fast and numerically stable algorithm for computing the discrete Hankel transform of order `0` as well as evaluating Schlomilch and Fourier-Bessel expansions in `O(N(log N)^2/loglog N)` operations. The algorithm is basedon an asymptotic expansion for Bessel functions of large arguments, the fast Fourier transform, and the Neumann addition formula.
